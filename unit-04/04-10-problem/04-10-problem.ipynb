    "There is a philosophy in business called [six sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma). According to Wikipedia, six sigma \"is a set of techniques and tools for process improvement. It was introduced by American engineer Bill Smith while working at Motorola in 1986. Jack Welch made it central to his business strategy at General Electric in 1995. A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature of a part are statistically expected to be free of defects.\"\n",

Where does this number come from? Let's simulate it. **At first, we will only use one sigma. Then we will increase it later.** \n",
