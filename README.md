# HNR 1300 Quantitative Reasoning: Mathematical Modeling

This is the GitHub repository for HNR 1300 Quantitative Reasoning: Mathematical Modeling at High Point University.

### Honors Course Description

Students interpret relationships in nature through mathematical equations, developing facility with mathematical languages and methods of symbolic representation. Students also explore the methods, rhetoric, and ethics of data accumulation, categorization, and representation. Students complete one unit-length project.


### Course Description

This course is a project-based introduction to mathematical modeling. A mathematical model is a set of equations, determined from simplifying assumptions and constraints, to describe a system. Students will learn to construct models to solve real-world systems in physics, biology, economics, and social science. Students will learn techniques to solve models, will use their models to make predictions, and will use measured data to test and refine their models. Finally, students will learn tools to facilitate writing data- and code-driven narratives.
