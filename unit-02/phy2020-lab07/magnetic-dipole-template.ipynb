    "# Lab 07 - Measuring $B(r)$ and Magnetic Dipole Moment\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. determine $(B)$ as a function of distance $(r)$ along the axis of a coil and determine whether the coil can be modeled as a magnetic dipole.\n",
    "2. measure the magnetic dipole moment of a coil.\n",
    "3. determine $(B)$ as a function of distance $(r)$ along the axis of a magnet and determine whether the magnet can be modeled as a magnetic dipole.\n",
    "4. measure the magnetic dipole moment of a magnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A magnetic dipole *by definition* creates a magnetic field on the axis of the dipole that has a magnitude\n",
    "\n",
    "$$B = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{2\\mu}{r^3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r$ is the distance from the dipole, and $\\mu$ is the magnetic dipole moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a current loop of radius $R$ and area $A=\\pi R^2$, the magnetic field due to the loop at a distance $r$ on the axis is the same as a magnetic dipole if $r>>R$. Then,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$B \\approx \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{2\\mu}{r^3}\\ , \\quad \\mu = IA \\qquad\\ \\mbox{for}\\ r\\gg R$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Apparatus\n",
    "\n",
    "### Magnetic Field Sensor\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a magnetic field sensor that measures $B$ along the axis of the sensor (only).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine the sensor now. Set the sensivity switch on its most sensitive setting (approximately 0.3 mT). The sensor also shows an arrow pointing away from the sensor that shows the default positive direction of the reading. If the magnetic field points *away* from the sensor, the reading is positive. If the magnetic field points *toward* the sensor, the reading is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connect the sensor to the LabQuest data acquisition (DAQ) device.\n",
    "2. Open the *Logger Pro* software. By default, it will detect the magnetic field sensor and show its instantaneous reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Track and Coil\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use an aluminum track (which does not interact with magnetic fields, unlike iron, nickel, and other materials) to align the magnetic field sensor and coil (or magnet) and precisely measure distance between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up the sensor and coil on the track as shown below. The sensor should be aligned with the axis of the coil. It helps to align the platform and coil with the edge of the track. Use a rubber band, if necessary, to hold the sensor on the platform. Otherwise, you will have to hold it as you make measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![](sensor-coil.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In Logger Pro, go to the menu **Experiment$\\to$Zero** or click the *0* icon in the toolbar to zero the sensor. **Do not move the sensor after it is zeroed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Connect the coil to the power supply. Set the power supply on 5.0 V.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the magnetic field sensor to determine the direction of the magnetic field due to current in the coil. Using the right hand rule (RHR), what is the direction that current flows around the coil? \n",
    "\n",
    "  Now examine the coil. Current flows in the direction of the electric field in the wire, toward lower electric potential. Is current flowing in the direction you predicted?\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Discuss your prediction and observation with the instructor.**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now, if necessary, change the connections to the coil such that the magnetic field reading by the sensor is positive."
