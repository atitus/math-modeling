    "\n",
    "In 2011, physics students Tiffany Byerly and Amelia Morgan did a project to measure their walking gait before and after running on a treadmill. They wanted if running on a treadmill for 5 minutes affects how a person walks immediately after running on the treadmill. Using video analysis software, they measured and plotted the approximate $(x,y)$ coordinate of Tiffany's center of mass in meters as a function of time in seconds. A screen capture of the video of one of their trials, after running on a treadmill, is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](gait.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The origin of the x,y coordinate system is at the intersection of the purple lines in the bottom left corner of the image. The origin is $(x=0,y=0)$, and the horizontal purple line represents the x-axis in space and the vertical purple line represents the y axis in space. The image below shows how her x-position indicates how far she is horizontally from the origin. Her y-position indicates how far she is vertically from the origin.\n",

    "![](gait-coord-system.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If $t$ is time, when she walks, we can graph $x$ vs. $t$ to figure out how she moves horizontally when walking. And we can graph $y$ vs. $t$ to figure out how she moves vertically when walking.\n"
