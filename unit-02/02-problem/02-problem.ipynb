    "In 2010, HPU alumna and honors student Nikki Sanford (who is now a patent attorney in Seattle, WA) did a project analyzing the motion of a hula hoop rotating around a person's arm. To repeat the experiment more carefully, she custom-built an apparatus using a drill and bicycle hub (tied to the ceiling with a flexible string to keep its orientation fixed). The apparatus is shown below.\n",

    "<img src=\"hula-hoop.jpg\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "She got the hula hoop rotating around the hub and analyzed the $x$ position of a sticker on the hula hoop as a function of time. A frame of the video she analyzed is shown below.\n",
