    "In 2010, HPU alumna and honors student Nikki Sanford (who is now a patent attorney in Seattle, WA) did a project analyzing the motion of a hula hoop rotating around a person's arm. In order to repeat the experiment more systematically, she custom-built an apparatus using a drill and bicycle hub (tied to the ceiling with a flexible string to keep its orientation fixed). The apparatus is shown below.\n",

    "This beat pattern is also encountered in acoustics when sound of two different frequencies interferes, so it gave Nikki a clue about the emperical model that would fit the data. (Later, she derived the model from theory and *explained* the beat pattern. Applying theory to explain the emperical model is always more significant than the emperical model itself.)\n"

    "In Earth's atmosphere, a horizontal circular \"disk\" of air has to support the weight of the column of air above it. As a result, near Earth's surface the air pressure is greater than the air pressure at higher alitudes because near Earth, it has to support the weight of a much taller column. As a result, air pressure decreases with altitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "For similar reasons, as you go deeper in water, the water pressure increases. But air is also compressible. Thus, near Earth, supporting a tall column of air causes the air to compress and become more dense. At higher altitudes the air pressure is less so the air compresses less and is less dense. This variation in air density also contributes to a decreasing air pressure. As a result, the air pressure decreases non-linearly.\n",

Along the way, he measured the air pressure as a function of the altitude of the balloon."
